# Topics

A curated collection of markdown index files summarizing key topics in programming, data science, and computer engineering. Each file covers a specific topic and provides core concepts, best practices, and resources.

## Directory Structure

Files follow the naming convention `index_<topic>.md`. Examples include:

- `index_ai.md`: Artificial Intelligence fundamentals
- `index_python.md`: Python programming
- `index_data_engineering.md`: Data engineering concepts
- `index_computer_vision.md`: Computer vision techniques
- `index_system_design.md`: System design principles
- â€¦

## Usage

Open any `index_<topic>.md` file with a markdown editor or viewer to explore:

- **Overview**: A brief introduction to the topic
- **Key Concepts**: Core ideas and terminology
- **Example Code**: Snippets illustrating usage
- **Further Reading**: Links to tutorials and documentation

## Adding New Topics

1. Create a new file named `index_<new_topic>.md`.
2. Include sections for Overview, Key Concepts, Example Code, and Resources.
3. Optionally update this README to list the new topic.
